=============

A board game in which the objective is to make all squares of the board blue or red, depending on the player. The board starts with N x N (default 6 x 6) white squares with 0 dots. Every turn, a player can add a spot onto a white square or onto a square of his color. If a square has more spots than its neighbors (up, down, left, and right), then it will add one spot to each of its neighbors. This is a recursive procedure and will continue to add spots until no square has more spots than its neighbors.
