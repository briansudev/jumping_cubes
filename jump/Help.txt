Summary: The object of jumping cubes is to take over the board. This is done by adding a dot to a square every turn. Once a square has more dots than its neighbors, it will reallocate a dot to its neighbors. A square's neighbors are above, below, to the left, and to the right of the square. By default, you will play against an AI. If you wish the other player to be your friend or some random stranger next to you, use the "manual" command as stated below. Anyways, best of luck.

clear 
	Abandons the current game (if one is in progress), and 	clears the board to its initial configuration (all squares neutral). Playing stops until the next start command.
start 
	Start playing the game from the current position.
quit
	Exits the program.
auto P 
 	Stops the current game until the next start command and causes 	player P to be played by an automated player (an AI) on subsequent moves. The value P must be RED or BLUE
     (ignore case: red and blue also work). Initially, Blue is an automated player.
manual P 
	Stops the current game until the next start command and causes player P to take moves from the terminal on subsequent moves. The value of P is as for the auto command. 
    Initially, Red is a manual player.
size N
	Stops any current game, clears the board to its initial configuration, and sets the size of the board to N squares. Initially, N = 6.
move N
	Stop any current game, set the number of the next move N. 
set R C N P 
	Stop any current game. Put N spots at row R and column C (see §3.1). P is either ‘b’ or ‘r’ (for blue or red,) indicating the color of the square. When N i     less 0, P is ignored and the square is cleared.
dump
	This command is especially for testing and debugging. It prints the board out in exactly the following format:
    ===
        2r -- 2r 2r -- 2b
        -- -- 2r -- 3r --
        2r 3r 2r 3r -- 2b
        3r 1r 3r 2r 2r 2b
        2b 4r 3r 1r 3r 2b
        2b 2b 3b 2r 3b 1b
	===
	with the === markers at the left margin and other lines indented four spaces. Here, -- indicates a neutral square, Nr indicates a red square with N spots, and Nb indicates a    blue square with N spots.
